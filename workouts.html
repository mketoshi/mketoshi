            <p> <ul>
                <li>Ask your health care provider at your first prenatal exam if exercising while pregnant is safe for you.</li>
                <li>Each week, healthy pregnant women should engage in at least 2½ hours of aerobic activity, such as walking or swimming.</li>
                <li>Regular physical activity might help you avoid pregnancy problems and alleviate pregnancy discomforts like back pain.</li>
                <li>Some activities, such as basketball, hot yoga, downhill skiing, horseback riding and scuba diving, aren’t safe during pregnancy.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Is it safe to exercise during pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>If you want to exercise while you're pregnant, talk to your doctor. Exercising while pregnant is generally safe and beneficial to both you and your baby. <br> Exercise will not enhance your chances of suffering a miscarriage (when a baby dies in the womb before 20 weeks of pregnancy), a premature baby (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy), or a baby born with low birthweight if you and your pregnancy are healthy (less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces).</p>
        <h2>How much exercise do you need during pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>Every week, healthy pregnant women should engage in at least 2½ hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Aerobic activities cause you to breathe more quickly and deeply, as well as increase the rate at which your heart beats. You're active enough to sweat and raise your heart rate at a moderate level. Moderate-intensity aerobic activity includes things like going for a quick walk. You may be working too hard if you can't converse normally during an activity. <br> You are not need to complete all 2½ hours at once. Instead, spread it out over the course of the week. Do 30 minutes of exercise on most or all days, for example. If 30 minutes sounds like a lot, break it up by doing something active for 10 minutes three times a day.</p>
        <h2>Why is physical activity during pregnancy good for you? </h2>
        <p>For healthy pregnant women, regular exercise can: <ul>
            <li>Keep your mind and body in good shape. Physical activity can make you feel better and provide you with additional energy. It also helps you stay fit by strengthening your heart, lungs, and blood vessels.</li>
            <li>Assist you in gaining the appropriate amount of weight during your pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Ease some common discomforts of pregnancy, such as constipation, back pain and swelling in your legs, ankles and feet.</li>
            <li>Assist you in bettering your stress management and sleeping habits. Worry, strain, or pressure are feelings you have in response to events in your life.</li>
            <li>Reduce your chances of developing pregnancy issues like gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Diabetes that develops during pregnancy is known as gestational diabetes. It occurs when your blood has an excessive amount of sugar (glucose). Preeclampsia is a type of high blood pressure that affects some women after the 20th week of pregnancy or shortly after delivery. These disorders can raise your chances of having pregnancy difficulties, such as early birth (birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy).</li>
            <li>Assist in lowering your chances of having a cesarean birth (also called c-section). Cesarean birth is a surgical procedure in which your baby is delivered through a cut in your belly and uterus made by your obstetrician.</li>
            <li>Get your body ready for labor and delivery. Prenatal yoga and Pilates, for example, can help you practice breathing, meditation, and other relaxing techniques to help you handle labor pain. Exercise might provide you the energy and power you need to get through labor.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>What kinds of activities are safe during pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>It's normally okay to continue your activities during pregnancy if you're healthy and exercised before getting pregnant. To be sure, check with your service provider. If you're a runner, tennis player, or engage in other forms of intensive activity, you may be able to continue your activities while pregnant. You may need to adjust some exercises or lighten up on your workouts as your belly grows larger later in pregnancy. <br> Choose activities that you enjoy if your provider thinks it's okay for you to exercise. If you didn't exercise before to becoming pregnant, now is an excellent time to begin. Consult your healthcare practitioner about safe activities. Begin softly and gradually increase your fitness. Start with 5 minutes of action per day and gradually increase to 30 minutes per day. <br> These activities usually are safe during pregnancy: <ul>
            <li><strong>Walking. </strong>A fast walk is a terrific way to get a good workout without putting too much strain on your joints and muscles. This is an excellent activity to start with if you're new to exercise.</li>
            <li><strong>Swimming and water workouts. </strong>Moving against the water helps keep your heart rate up while supporting the weight of your growing baby. It's also gentle on your muscles and joints. Try swimming if you experience low back pain from other sports.</li>
            <li><strong>Riding a stationary bike. </strong>It is safer to do this than to ride a standard bicycle when pregnant. Even as your belly swells, you're less likely to fall off a stationary bike than you are on a regular bike.</li>
            <li><strong>Yoga and Pilates classes. </strong>Inform your yoga or Pilates instructor that you are expecting. The instructor can assist you in modifying or avoiding positions that are potentially dangerous for pregnant women, including as laying flat on your back or reclining on your stomach (after the first trimester). Prenatal yoga and Pilates classes are available at several gyms and community centers exclusively for pregnant mothers.</li>
            <li><strong>Low-impact aerobics classes. </strong>One foot is constantly on the ground or equipment during low-impact aerobics. Walking, riding a stationary bike, and utilizing an elliptical machine are all examples of low-impact aerobics. Low-impact aerobics are less strenuous on the body than high-impact aerobics. Both feet leave the ground at the same time during high-impact aerobics. Running, jumping rope, and jumping jacks are just a few examples. Inform your teacher that you are expecting a child so that they can help you alter your workout if necessary.</li>
            <li><strong>Strength training. </strong>Strength training can help you build muscle and make your bones strong. It’s safe to work out with weights as long as they’re not too heavy. Ask your provider about how much you can lift.</li>
        </ul>
        To be active, you don't need to join a gym or have particular equipment. You can go for a walk in a safe area or perform home fitness videos. Alternatively, discover methods to be more active in your daily life, such as doing yard work or using the stairs rather than the elevator.</p>
        <h2>Is physical activity safe for all pregnant women?</h2>
        <p>No. Exercising during pregnancy is not recommended for certain women. Your healthcare professional can advise you on whether or not exercise is appropriate for you.</p>
        <h2>What kinds of activities aren’t safe during pregnancy?</h2>
        <p>Be careful and check with your provider when choosing your activities. During pregnancy, don’t do:<ul>
                <li>Any activity that has a lot of jerky, bouncing movements that may cause you to fall, like horseback riding, downhill skiing, off-road cycling, gymnastics or skating.</li>
                <li>Any sport in which you may be hit in the belly, such as ice hockey, boxing, soccer or basketball. </li>
                <li>Any exercise that makes you lie flat on your back (after the first trimester), like sit-ups. When you lie on your back, your uterus puts pressure on a large vein that brings blood back to your heart. Lying on your back can cause your blood pressure to drop and limit the flow of blood to your baby.</li>
                <li>Activities that can cause you to hit water with great force, like water skiing, surfing or diving.</li>
                <li>Skydiving or scuba diving. Scuba diving can lead to decompression sickness. This is when dangerous gas bubbles form in your baby's body.</li>
                <li>Exercising at high altitude (more than 6,000 feet), unless you live at a high altitude. Altitude is the height of something above the ground. For example, if you’re at high altitude, you’re probably in the mountains. Exercising at high altitudes during pregnancy can lower the amount of oxygen that reaches your baby. </li>
                <li>Activities that may make your body temperature too high, like Bikram yoga (also called hot yoga) or exercising outside on hot, humid days. During Bikram yoga, you do yoga in a room where the temperature is set to 95 F to 100 F. It’s not safe for pregnant women because it can cause hyperthermia, a condition that happens when your body temperature gets too high. Some studies suggest that spending too much time in a sauna or hot tub may make your body temperature too high and increase your risk of having a baby who has birth defects. To be safe, don’t spend more than 15 minutes at a time in a sauna or more than 10 at a time minutes in a hot tub.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Does pregnancy change how your body responds to exercise?</h2>
        <p>During pregnancy, your body changes in many ways. When you’re active, you may notice changes in your: <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance. </strong>You may notice that you lose your balance more easily during pregnancy.</li>
            <li><strong>Body temperature. </strong>body temperature is slightly higher during pregnancy, so you start sweating sooner than you did before pregnancy.</li>
            <li><strong>Breathing. </strong>As your baby develops and your body changes, you need more oxygen. Your growing belly puts pressure on your diaphragm, a muscle that helps you breathe. You may even find yourself feeling short of breath at times.</li>
            <li><strong>Energy. </strong>Your body’s working hard to take care of your baby, so you may have less energy during pregnancy.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart rate. </strong>Your heart works harder and beats faster during pregnancy to get oxygen to your baby.</li>
            <li><strong>Joints. </strong>Your body makes more of some hormones during pregnancy. This can make the tissues that support your joints more relaxed. Try to avoid any movements that may strain or hurt your joints.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2>When should you stop exercising? What are the warning signs you should watch for when exercising?</h2>
        <p>When you’re being physically active, drink lots of water and pay attention to your body and how you feel. Stop your activity and call your provider if you have any of these signs or symptoms: <ul>
            <li>Bleeding from the vagina or fluid leaking from the vagina</li>
            <li>Chest pain, fast heartbeat or trouble breathing</li>
            <li>Feeling dizzy or faint</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Muscle weakness, difficulty walking, or pain or swelling in your lower legs are all signs that you need to see a doctor. Deep vein thrombosis can cause pain and edema in your lower legs (also called DVT). A blood clot forms in a deep vein in the body, generally in the lower leg or thigh, causing DVT. It can lead to major health concerns and even death if left untreated.</li>
            <li>Consistent, painful contractions. The muscles of your uterus contract and then relax during a contraction. Contractions aid in the expulsion of your baby from your uterus.</li>
            <li>Your child has ceased to move. This could be a sign of a stillbirth (when a baby dies in the womb after 20 weeks of pregnancy).</li>
        </ul> </p>
        <h2>When can you start exercising again after giving birth? </h2>
        <p>Find out when it's safe for you to resume physical activity by speaking with your doctor. It's normally fine to begin exercising a few days after giving birth or as soon as you're ready if you had a vaginal birth with no difficulties. The uterus contracts during vaginal birth to assist in pushing your baby out of the vaginal canal (birth canal). <br> You may need to wait longer to begin exercising after birth if you had a c-section or if there were difficulties after delivery. Your healthcare professional can advise you on when your body is ready to exercise. <br> It'll be easier to get back into shape once your kid is born if you were active during your pregnancy. Simply begin cautiously. Stop exercising if you have discomfort or other issues, and speak with your healthcare professional. </p>
