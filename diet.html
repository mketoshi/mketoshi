        <h1 class="doh1">Healthy Diet</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A nutritious diet is crucial at any time, but it's especially critical if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Healthy nutrition keeps you feeling good and provides your baby with the nutrients he or she requires while still in the womb. <br> Aim for a well-balanced diet that includes a good mix of foods from each of the five food groups: <ol>
                <li>vegetables and legumes</li>
                <li>breads and cereals</li>
                <li>milk, yoghurt and cheese</li>
                <li>meat, poultry, fish and alternatives</li>
                <li>fruits</li>
            </ol> Drink plenty of water every day; most municipal water contains fluoride, which aids in the development of strong enamel in your growing child's teeth. Fluoride isn't present in all water supplies, even tank water. <br> Even if you are expecting twins or triplets, you will most likely feel more hungry than usual. However, you do not need to 'feed for two.' Concentrate on the quality of your diet rather than the amount. <br> Rather than eliminating all of your favorite meals, eating healthily frequently just simply modifying the quantities of different items you eat to keep your diet diverse. If you eat a healthy breakfast every day, it will be simpler to avoid snacking on high-fat, high-sugar meals. <br> Certain foods should also be avoided since they are unhealthy or dangerous for the infant. <br> If you acquire gestational diabetes, your doctor or midwife will urge you to be careful with your diet.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Fruit and vegetables</h2>
        <p>Fruit and vegetables are good sources of vitamins and minerals, as well as fiber, which aids digestion and avoids constipation. A variety of fruits and vegetables should be consumed every day, whether they are fresh, frozen, canned, dried, or juiced. Always wash them with care. To get the most out of the nutrients in veggies, softly steam them in a little water or eat them raw but thoroughly cleansed.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Starchy foods (carbohydrates)</h2>
        <p>Starchy foods are high in vitamins and fibre, as well as being filling without being excessively calorie-dense. Bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, maize, millet, oats, sweet potatoes, yams, and cornmeal are some of the items on the list. Every meal should include these meals as a main course. When possible, choose wholemeal flour over processed (white) flour.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Protein</h2>
        <p>Protein-rich foods aid the development of the infant. Meat (but not liver), fish (but not shark/flake, marlin, or broadbill/swordfish), poultry, eggs, beans, legumes/beans, and nuts are all good sources of protein. Every day, consume protein. Choose lean meats, remove the skin off birds, and cook them with only a small amount of fat. <br> Ensure that all eggs, poultry, pork, burgers, and sausages are fully cooked. Check for pink or red meat, as well as pink or red fluids in the juices. 2 servings of fish per week are recommended, one of which should be oily fish like sardines or mackerel.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Dairy</h2>
        <p>Milk, cheese, and yoghurt are crucial dairy foods because they include calcium and other nutrients that your infant requires. Wherever possible, use reduced-fat choices. Some cheeses should be avoided at all costs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Healthy snacks</h2>
        <p>If you are hungry in between meals, avoid high-fat and/or sugar snacks such sweets, biscuits, crisps, or chocolate. Instead, opt for one of the following healthy snacks: <ul>
            <li>sandwiches or pitta bread filled with grated cheese, grilled chicken, mashed tuna, salmon or sardines and salad</li>
            <li>salad vegetables, such as carrot, celery or cucumber</li>
            <li>low-fat yoghurt hummus with bread or vegetable sticks</li>
            <li>ready-to-eat apricots, figs or prunes</li>
            <li>vegetable and bean soups</li>
            <li>unsweetened breakfast cereals, or porridge, with milk</li>
            <li>milky drinks or unsweetened fruit juices</li>
            <li>fresh fruit</li>
            <li>baked beans on toast or a baked potato</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Foods to limit</h2>
        <p>When you are pregnant, you should reduce your intake of: <ul>
            <li>foods that are high in sugar, such as chocolate, biscuits, pastries, ice-cream, cake, puddings and soft drinks. Sugar contains calories without providing any other nutrients, and can contribute to weight gain, obesity and tooth decay</li>
            <li>foods that are high in fat, such as all spreading fats (including butter), oils, salad dressings and cream. Fat is very high in calories, and eating more fatty foods is likely to make you put on weight. Having too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases the chance of developing heart disease. Try to cut down on saturated fat, and have foods rich in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat instead, such as oils, spreads, nut butters/pastes and avocado</li>
            <li>foods that contain added salt. Don’t add salt in cooking or at the table</li>
            <li>alcohol: There is no safe level of alcohol during your pregnancy. Whether you are planning a pregnancy, already pregnant or breastfeeding, not drinking is the safest option as alcohol can harm your unborn baby</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Preparing food safely</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma, a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis, which can harm your unborn baby.</li>
                <li>Wash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw meat — this will help to avoid toxoplasmosis and other infections such as listeria, campylobacter and salmonella.</li>
                <li>Store raw foods separately from ready-to-eat foods to prevent contamination that leads to food poisoning from meat (such as salmonella, campylobacter and E. Coli).</li>
                <li>Use a separate chopping board for raw meats.</li>
                <li>Heat ready meals until they're piping hot all the way through — this is especially important for meals containing poultry.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h1 class="doh1">Foods to avoid when pregnant</h1>
        <br>
        <p>When you're pregnant, there are some things you shouldn't eat because they could make you sick or harm your baby. Make sure you're aware of the key facts regarding the foods you should avoid or avoid with caution while pregnant. The best dishes to consume are those that have been freshly cooked or prepared.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Some types of cheese</h2>
        <p>Mold-ripened soft cheeses like brie, camembert, and chevre (a type of goat's cheese), as well as others with a similar rind, should be avoided. Soft blue-veined cheeses, such as Danish blue or gorgonzola, should also be avoided. These are manufactured with mold and may contain listeria, a germ that can damage an unborn child. <br>
        Although listeria infection (listeriosis) is uncommon, particular precautions should be taken during pregnancy because even a minor form of the sickness in a pregnant woman can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe illness in the newborn baby. <br> Even though hard cheeses like cheddar, parmesan, and stilton are created with unpasteurized milk, you can eat them. Bacteria are less likely to grow in hard cheeses because they contain less water than soft cheeses. Many different forms of cheese are acceptable, but they must be manufactured from pasteurized milk. Cottage cheese, mozzarella, cream cheese, paneer, haloumi, goat's cheese, and processed cheeses like cheese spreads are just a few examples.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Pâté</h2>
        <p>Avoid all types of pâté, including vegetable pâtés, as they can contain listeria.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Raw or partially cooked eggs</h2>
        <p>Ensure that the eggs are properly cooked, with solid whites and yolks. Salmonella food poisoning is avoided as a result of this. Foods containing raw or undercooked eggs, such as homemade mayonnaise, should be avoided. Consider using pasteurised liquid egg if you want to make recipes with raw or partially cooked eggs. Use only fresh eggs that aren't broken or soiled.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Raw or undercooked meat</h2>
        <p>Cook all meat and poultry thoroughly until it is piping hot and no pink or blood remains. Take extra caution when handling poultry, pig, sausages, and minced meat, such as burgers. <br> Rare meat should not be consumed. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can be spread by meat, dirt, cat feces, and unclean water. The infection can harm your baby if you're pregnant, but it's crucial to note that toxoplasmosis in pregnancy is extremely rare. <br> If you think you might have been at risk, talk to your doctor, midwife, or obstetrician about it. Toxoplasmosis treatment is available if you become infected while pregnant. <br>After cooking raw meat, thoroughly wash all surfaces and equipment. It's also crucial to remember to wash and dry your hands after handling raw meat. This can assist to prevent the spread of hazardous bacteria that can cause food poisoning, such as salmonella, campylobacter, and E. coli. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Liver products</h2>
        <p>Don't consume liver or liver products like liver pâté or liver sausage because they're high in vitamin A. Vitamin A overdose might be harmful to your child.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Supplements containing vitamin A</h2>
        <p>Don't take high-dose multivitamin supplements, fish liver oil supplements or any supplements containing vitamin A.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Some types of fish</h2>
        <p>Fish is advised during pregnancy because it includes protein and necessary omega-3 fatty acids. <br> Some fish, however, contain greater levels of mercury, which can harm a baby's growing brain system. It's critical to restrict your consumption of fish that contain high amounts of mercury. Shark (flake), broadbill, marlin, and swordfish should only be eaten once every two weeks, and no other fish should be eaten during that time. Only eat orange roughy and catfish once a week, and no other fish should be consumed during that time.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Raw shellfish</h2>
        <p>Cooked seafood is preferable to raw shellfish because raw shellfish can contain hazardous bacteria and viruses that can cause food poisoning and is more susceptible to listeria infection.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Pre-packaged salads</h2>
        <p>Pre-prepared or pre-packaged fruit or vegetable salads, including those from buffets and salad bars have a higher risk of listeria contamination.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Certain fruit and vegetables</h2>
        <p>Don’t eat rockmelon, due to a risk of listeria, or bean sprouts, due to salmonella.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Sushi</h2>
        <p>Avoid cold seafood, such as raw oysters, sashimi, and sushi, as well as smoked ready-to-eat seafood and cooked ready-to-eat prawns, as they are more likely to contain listeria. <br> The safest way to enjoy sushi is to choose the fully cooked or vegetarian varieties, such as those that include: <ul>
            <li>cooked seafood, for example fully cooked eel (unagi) or shrimp (ebi)</li>
            <li>vegetables, for example cucumber (kappa) maki</li>
            <li>avocado — for example California roll</li>
            <li>fully cooked egg</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Cold cured meats</h2>
        <p>Cold cured meats include salami, parma ham, chorizo and pepperoni. In Australia, pregnant women are advised to avoid eating cold cured meats or smoked fish as there is a small risk of these foods harbouring listeria, or the toxoplasma parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. These include: <ul>
            <li>cold meats from delicatessen counters and sandwich bars, and packaged, sliced ready-to-eat meats</li>
            <li>cold cooked ready-to-eat chicken (whole, portions, or diced)</li>
        </ul></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Unpasteurised milk</h2>
        <p>If you have milk, drink only pasteurised or UHT (ultra-heat treated) milk (also called long-life milk). If only raw (unpasteurised) milk is available, boil it first. Don’t drink unpasteurised goat’s or sheep’s milk or eat food that is made out of them, such as soft goat’s cheese. <br> Don't eat soft-serve ice-creams while you're pregnant as they have a higher risk of listeria contamination.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Alcohol</h2>
        <p>There is no safe level of alcohol that you can have during your pregnancy. Whether you are planning a pregnancy, already pregnant or breastfeeding, not drinking is the safest option as alcohol can harm your unborn baby.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Caffeine</h2>
        <p>High levels of caffeine can increase the risk of miscarriage, low birth weight and experiencing a difficult birth. Caffeine is naturally found in lots of foods, such as coffee, tea and chocolate, and is added to some soft drinks and energy drinks. Some cold and flu remedies also contain caffeine. Talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist before taking these remedies. <br> You don’t need to cut out caffeine completely, but don’t have more than 200mg a day. The approximate amounts of caffeine found in food and drinks are: <ul>
            <li>1 cup of instant coffee: 60mg</li>
            <li>1 shot of espresso coffee: 100mg</li>
            <li>1 cup of plunger coffee: 80mg</li>
            <li>1 cup of tea: 30mg</li>
            <li>375ml can of cola: 49mg</li>
            <li>250ml can of energy drink: 80mg</li>
            <li>100g bar of milk chocolate: 20mg</li>
        </ul> Don’t worry if you occasionally have more than 200mg, the risks are quite small. To cut down on caffeine, try decaffeinated tea and coffee, fruit juice or mineral water instead of regular tea, coffee and cola.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Energy drinks</h2>
        <p>Energy drinks are not recommended during pregnancy as they may contain high levels of caffeine, and other ingredients not recommended for pregnant women.</p>
