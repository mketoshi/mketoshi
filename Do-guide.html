        <h1 class="doh1">Dos and Don’ts During Pregnancy</h1>
        <br>
        <div class="content">
        <p>You're responsible for helping your tiny bundle of joy grow in a nurturing, healthy environment before they come.This list of pregnancy dos and don'ts might help you figure out what you should be concerned about — and what you shouldn't.</p>
        <h2>Dos:</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Take Multivitamin</h3>
            <p>
                The best method to provide your body with all the healthy nutrition it needs to support a growing baby is to eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals. However, a healthy diet alone may not be sufficient for pregnancy. <br>
                Prenatal vitamins contain higher levels of certain nutrients that expectant mothers require at higher doses, such as: <ul>
                    <li>folic acid</li>
                    <li>calcium</li>
                    <li>iron</li></ul>
                These vitamins aid in the growth of the fetus and the prevention of birth abnormalities. Your doctor can assist you in selecting the appropriate multivitamin or vitamin combination for you. <br>
                DHA, EPA, or both are often found in multivitamins. Omega-3 fats are essential for your baby's brain development. <br>
                However, don't take more than one dose of multivitamins. Some vitamins might be dangerous to a baby if consumed in large doses.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>2. Do get lots of sleep</h3>
            <p>Sleep might be difficult to come by during your 9 months of pregnancy due to changing hormone levels, anticipation, and anxiety. Pregnancy is physically demanding, especially in the last trimester, and you'll need your rest. <br>
            If you're fatigued, take a quick nap and schedule naps whenever you can. Make a nighttime schedule and stick to it. <br>
            Each night, try to get 7-9 hours of sleep. Give yourself as much sleep as you can because fatigue is a symptom that your body needs additional rest.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>3. Do work out</h3>
            <p>
                Pregnant women no longer have to avoid lifting a finger during their pregnancies: We now know that exercise is beneficial to both the mother and the child. <br>
                In fact, regular exercise may help you deal with a variety of pregnancy-related concerns, including: <ul>
                    <li>insomnia</li>
                    <li>muscle pain</li>
                    <li>excessive weight gain</li>
                    <li>mood problems</li>
                </ul>
                Keep exercising if you were a regular exerciser before you became pregnant. Discuss any changes to your routine with your doctor, especially as you enter the second and third trimesters. <br>Ask your doctor about introducing a fitness program into your day if you didn't exercise frequently before you found out you were pregnant. They can help you find a program that is both safe and pleasant for you and your infant.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>4. Do eat seafood</h3>
            <p>
                Seafood is high in vitamins and minerals like omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and iron, all of which are good for your heart. All of these things are crucial for both mom and baby. However, raw or undercooked seafood might cause issues. <br> Seafood may contain hazardous bacteria and viruses, which are destroyed when cooked properly. Also, uncooked seafood and fish that may contain high amounts of mercury should be avoided by pregnant women. <br>
                Examples of fish containing high levels of mercury include: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>shark</li>
                    <li>swordfish</li>
                    <li>tilefish</li>
                    <li>king mackerel</li>
                </ul>
                Consume a variety of seafood to avoid a mineral deficiency caused by a single type of fish. Fish should not be consumed in excess of 12 ounces per week.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h3>5. Do have sex</h3>
                <p>Sex during pregnancy is fine, as long as you don’t have a complicating factor such as placenta previa or another type of high-risk pregnancy. <br>Sex is safe with your partner right up until your water breaks. If you have discomfort you may have to try new positions. Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about the safety of intercourse during your pregnancy.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>6. Do practice yoga</h3>
                <p>When you're pregnant, you should avoid Bikram or hot yoga, but other yoga methods are fine. Look for prenatal or gentle yoga classes tailored to expectant mothers. These classes' instructors will know which poses are optimal and which should be avoided. <br>If you haven't done yoga before becoming pregnant, consult your doctor before enrolling in a class. While you may be able to begin, it's wise to discuss the risks and concerns with your doctor.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>7. Do get a flu shot</h3>
                <p> As long as you don't have a contraindication listed by the manufacturer, pregnant women can and should get a flu vaccine. <br> It's not a live virus being injected. The flu vaccine does not protect against the virus. If you get influenza while pregnant, you're more likely to have serious side effects than women of same age who aren't. <br> You and your unborn child will both be protected by the immunization.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
        <h2>Dont's</h2>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>1. Don’t smoke</h3>
            <p>
                Babies born to pregnant women who smoke have a lower birth weight and are more likely to develop learning problems than children born to nonsmoking moms. <br> Due to physiologic nicotine addiction, children born to smoking mothers are more prone to attempt smoking at a younger age and become regular smokers sooner.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>2. Don’t drink alcohol</h3>
            <p>Alcohol may greatly impact your baby’s development. People who drink alcohol while pregnant could deliver a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). <br>
            Symptoms of FAS include: <ul>
                <li>low birth weight</li>
                <li>learning disabilities</li>
                <li>behavior problems</li>
                <li>lagging patterns in terms of growth and development milestones</li>
            </ul>
            Alcohol, even in little amounts, can be harmful. There appears to be no such thing as a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. <br> Consult your doctor as soon as possible if you need help quitting drinking while pregnant. The sooner you seek assistance, the healthier your kid will be.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>3. Don’t eat raw meat</h3>
            <p>Foodborne illnesses such as listeriosis and toxoplasmosis can be contracted from raw or undercooked meat and eggs. It's also possible that you'll get food poisoning. <br> These infections can result in serious, life-threatening illnesses, as well as birth deformities and even miscarriage. If you're pregnant, make sure all of the eggs and meat you eat are well cooked.</p>
        </div>
        <div>4. Don’t eat deli meat</div>
        <p>Foodborne illnesses like listeriosis and toxoplasmosis can be spread through deli foods like hot dogs, sausages, smoked salmon, and other cured meats. <br> Sliced meats provide a much larger surface area for bacteria to colonize. Your risk is reduced if you thoroughly boil these processed proteins. <br> Pasteurized (not raw) milk and cheese are also vital to consume. To help eradicate hazardous bacteria, wash produce as soon as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>5. Don’t eat unpasteurized milk products</h3>
            <p>Calcium is very important for growing babies, but moms have to be careful how they get their calcium from dairy. <br> Raw milk isn’t recommendedTrusted Source for expecting mothers since it’s unpasteurized. This means it hasn’t been heated to kill bacteria that could make you ill. <br> Specifically, raw milk may contain the bacteria Listeria. It can lead to illness, miscarriage, or even life-threatening consequences.</p>
        </div>
        <div> 
            <h3>6. Don’t sit in a hot tub or sauna</h3>
            <p>Though relaxing, the high-heat environment of hot tubs, Jacuzzis, and saunas may be too dangerous for expecting mothers. <br>In fact, research suggests that using one of these during your first trimester may double your risk of miscarriage. Soaking in hot water can raise body temperature and this causes problems with the baby including increasing the risk of birth defects.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>7. Don’t drink a lot of caffeine</h3>
            <p>Caffeine can travel through the placenta and increase your baby’s heart rate. <br> Current research suggests that women can safely consume a cup or two of coffee each day, but forego downing a triple-shot latte while you’re carrying.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>8. Don’t clean the cat’s litter box</h3>
            <p>Pet your pet as much as you like and then wash your hands — but don't clean a cat's litter box. <br> Millions of bacteria and parasites live in feline feces. Toxoplasma gondii, in particular, is extremely harmful to expectant mothers. <br> If you get it, you might not know until you start having problems with your pregnancy. It's possible to have a miscarriage or a stillbirth. This parasite can cause major health problems in babies, including convulsions and mental disorders.</p>
